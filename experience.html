    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

    <!-- ===================== AlgaQ ===================== -->
    <h3>Electrical Engineer — AlgaQ (Qatar Science & Technology Park)</h3>
    <p><em>Oct 2025 – Dec 2025</em></p>
    <p>
      At AlgaQ, I supported the design and development of smart microalgae
      bioreactor systems focused on sustainability, carbon capture, and
      data-driven optimization. My role combined embedded electronics,
      sensor integration, and system-level thinking within a multidisciplinary
      R&D environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on integrating environmental sensors and control circuits to
      monitor and regulate critical growth parameters such as light intensity,
      temperature, CO₂ concentration, and nutrient levels. This involved
      selecting appropriate sensors, designing interface circuitry, and
      supporting firmware and data acquisition workflows to enable reliable
      real-time monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, I contributed to the development of STEM-focused educational
      kits and climate stations, translating complex sensing and sustainability
      concepts into robust, easy-to-deploy hardware platforms. These systems
      were designed with reliability, clarity, and scalability in mind, making
      them suitable for both educational and community-level deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working closely with engineers, scientists, and innovators strengthened
      my ability to communicate technical decisions across disciplines and
      reinforced the importance of system integration when developing
      real-world sustainability solutions.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== Easyvam ===================== -->
    <h3>Electrical Engineer & Sales Executive — Easyvam (ClickOrder.io)</h3>
    <p><em>May 2025 – Sep 2025</em></p>
    <p>
      At Easyvam, I held a hybrid technical and client-facing role that combined
      engineering support with product demonstrations and post-sale technical
      engagement. This position strengthened my ability to translate technical
      concepts into practical solutions aligned with user needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the engineering side, I supported R&D efforts by evaluating new product
      features, assisting with prototyping, and providing technical feedback
      based on real client usage. I worked closely with development teams to
      improve core system functionalities and overall platform reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, I led product demonstrations, supported lead generation, and
      handled post-sale technical support. This experience sharpened my
      understanding of system usability, deployment constraints, and the
      importance of designing technology that performs reliably in real
      operational environments.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== SCORPE Tech ===================== -->
    <h3>Design Engineer — SCORPE Tech</h3>
    <p><em>Dec 2023 – Nov 2024</em></p>
    <p>
      At SCORPE Tech, I worked on the development of autonomous drone systems
      integrating computer vision, embedded processing, and real-time control.
      My primary focus was on perception pipelines, hardware integration, and
      autonomous navigation reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I contributed to building a real-time license plate recognition (LPR)
      system by collecting and labeling over 900 images, managing dataset
      splits, and training a YOLOv8-based detection model. The trained model
      achieved high accuracy while maintaining low-latency inference suitable
      for onboard deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond model training, I worked on integrating the AI perception pipeline
      into the drone’s flight-control stack, ensuring reliable communication
      between the vision system, onboard compute, and navigation logic. This
      required careful consideration of latency, computational limits, and
      system stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also supported hardware integration tasks, including camera installation
      and calibration using a gimbal-stabilized setup, autonomous route
      generation, and LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance. These contributions helped
      improve flight safety and reduce collision risk in complex environments.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== Internships ===================== -->
    <h3>Electrical Engineering Intern — SCORPE Tech</h3>
    <p><em>Sep 2023 – Oct 2023</em></p>
    <p>
      During my internship, I focused on hands-on electronics and mechanical
      integration tasks. I designed and simulated multiple PCB circuits using
      KiCad and EasyEDA, assisted with assembly and debugging, and supported
      rapid prototyping using 3D modeling and printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also worked on building sensor modules with custom enclosures, helping
      streamline deployment and reduce setup time. This experience strengthened
      my practical understanding of PCB design, manufacturing constraints, and
      hardware debugging workflows.
    </p>

    <h3>Electrical Engineering Intern — SLB (Schlumberger)</h3>
    <p><em>Jun 2023 – Aug 2023</em></p>
    <p>
      At SLB, I worked within the Reservoir Performance group, gaining exposure
      to industrial-scale engineering workflows, safety protocols, and
      traceability-driven assembly processes. I assisted with the assembly and
      testing of downhole connectors and contributed to detailed technical
      reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also proposed and designed a structured improvement plan to integrate
      OCR-based tools into reporting workflows, significantly reducing manual
      documentation time and improving operational efficiency. This experience
      highlighted the impact of small automation improvements in large-scale
      industrial environments.
