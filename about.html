    <h2>Engineering Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Electrical Engineer with a strong interest in building intelligent,
      real-world systems that combine electronics, embedded software, sensing,
      and data-driven decision making. I graduated from Qatar University in 2024,
      where my academic foundation in electrical engineering evolved into a
      practical focus on embedded systems, IoT platforms, and applied artificial
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than working in isolated domains, I gravitated toward projects and
      roles that required understanding the entire system — from circuit-level
      design and signal conditioning to firmware logic, communication protocols,
      and higher-level data processing. This system-oriented mindset has shaped
      how I approach engineering problems and design trade-offs.

    <h2>Engineering Mindset & Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My technical interests sit at the intersection of hardware and intelligence.
      I am particularly motivated by problems where embedded systems must operate
      under real constraints such as limited power, latency requirements, noisy
      sensor data, and unpredictable environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through academic projects, industry experience, and hackathons, I have
      worked on systems including autonomous drones, smart traffic infrastructure,
      environmental monitoring platforms, and image-driven analytical pipelines.
      These experiences reinforced my interest in applied R&D roles where
      engineering decisions directly affect system reliability, performance,
      and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also deeply interested in sustainable and climate-focused technologies,
      including sensor-based environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and
      carbon capture solutions. I see embedded intelligence as a key enabler for
      scalable, data-informed sustainability systems.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering</strong><br>
      Qatar University, Doha<br>
      GPA: 3.1<br>
      Aug 2020 – Dec 2024
    </p>
    <p>
      My coursework covered core electrical engineering topics including circuit
      analysis, control systems, power systems, electronics, and signal processing.
      Alongside formal coursework, I consistently pursued hands-on projects,
      independent learning, and external courses in embedded systems, machine
      learning, and entrepreneurship to complement my academic foundation.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of formal education, I actively participated in hackathons,
      engineering clubs, and volunteer initiatives related to technology and
      innovation. These experiences exposed me to collaborative, fast-paced
      engineering environments and strengthened my ability to communicate
      technical ideas across multidisciplinary teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serving in leadership and technical roles within student organizations
      further developed my sense of responsibility, safety awareness, and
      systems-level planning — skills that translate directly into professional
      engineering work.
